# color-mixer
Interactive color mixer that allows a user to experiment with different combinations of RGB primaries.
The color mixer allows the user to experiment with different combinations of RGB primaries by left-clicking 
on either RGB lever and rasing or lowering the bar to the desired setting. The color will adjust according 
to the height level of the color bar and will be displayed in the top right color box. The user may use 
only one RBG lever at a time and must right-click the mouse when alternating between each lever. 
When a desired color is set, the user may select either the left or right side of the Gradient box by 
pressing the "L" or "R" button on the keyboard to apply the current color shade to the Gradient box. Once 
the Gradient box is set to the desired color pallette, the user may left-click the areas within the Gradient
box to adjust the changes in the color box. The levels of each RGB color bar will change depending on the 
current color displayed in the color box.
